So.. I made a blog to keep track of my rants and other random tidbits I happen to come across in my travails.

Setting this up was way more painful than I'd anticipated, mainly due to it using ruby, npm, and other things I'm not familiar with.

The theme is based off of a free jekyll theme available on GitHub called Chalk, but I felt like customising it a little.

Though, I'm not sure I'm entirely satisfied with it yet.
No matter, it will have to do for now.
It took me roughly 3 hours to get to this point, and for now that's enough tinkering with it.
